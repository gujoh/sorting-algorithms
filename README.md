# sorting-algorithms

Some sorting algorithms that I have made in order to learn Java and Git. 

Sorting algorithms can now be visualised (although it is far from perfect)!
Run MainGUI.java to see sorting algorithms in action.

## Files
- SortingAlgorithms.java contains all sorting algorithms, and a few methods
to set up the unsorted array.
- Main.java is there for testing the sorting algorithms.
- MainGUI.java contains methods that set up Java Swing, as well as sorting 
algorithms that have been modified for visualization.




### TODO
- Add more sorting algorithms. 
- Optimize sorting algorithms. 
- Make visualization of sorting algorithms better.
